# txm - A tmux Helper Tool

`txm` is a command-line utility designed to make working with tmux more efficient and user-friendly. It provides a set of commands to manage tmux sessions, windows, panes, and perform various actions.

## Features

- Create, list, attach to, detach from, rename, and kill tmux sessions
- Create, rename, close, and switch between windows
- Split panes vertically and horizontally
- Navigate between panes using arrow keys
- Resize panes
- Close panes
- Zoom in/out of panes
- Execute commands in panes
- Save and restore session layouts
- Set tmux options
- Execute scripts in specific panes
- Broadcast input to all panes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)
- tmux installed on your system

### Installation Steps


#### Recommended Method

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedElashri/txm-bash
   ```

2. Change into the `txm` directory:

   ```bash
   cd txm
   ```

3. Run the installation script:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   The installation script will perform the following actions:
   - Copy the `txm` script to `/usr/local/bin/` to make it globally accessible
   - Create the necessary configuration directories (`$HOME/.txm/layouts`)
   - Copy the `txm.1` man page to the appropriate location (`/usr/local/share/man/man1/`)
   - Update the man page index

4. Source your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) or start a new shell session for the changes to take effect.

#### Easy Method

An easier but not recommended and really you shouldn't be doing it is using `curl` or `wget` to fetch the script and pipe it to bash. 

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:


Using curl

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohamedElashri/txm-bash/main/install.sh)
```
Using wget

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohamedElashri/txm-bash/main/install.sh)
```

## Usage

`txm` provides a wide range of commands to interact with tmux. Here are a few examples:

- Create a new session:
  ```bash
  txm new my-session
  ```

- List all sessions:
  ```bash
  txm list
  ```

- Attach to a session:
  ```bash
  txm attach my-session
  ```

- Split pane vertically:
  ```bash
  txm vsplit
  ```

- Resize pane up by 5 units:
  ```bash
  txm resize U 5
  ```

- Execute a script in a specific pane:
  ```bash
  txm execute-script 0.1 script.sh
  ```

For a complete list of available commands and their usage, refer to the man page:

```bash
man txm
```

Or you can consult the [documentation](docs.md)

## Configuration

`txm` can be configured using a configuration file located at `$HOME/.txm/config`. The configuration file allows you to set default options and customize the behavior of `txm`.
